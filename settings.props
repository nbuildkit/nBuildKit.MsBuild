        The following ItemGroup defines which steps are taken during the build process. The order of the items in the item group
        determines in which order the build steps are executed.

        The following build steps are by default provided through the given properties:
        $(BuildStepsPrepareWorkspace)                    - Deletes the existing build artifacts and creates the required directories.
        $(BuildStepsPrepareRestoreNuGet)                 - Restores the NuGet packages for the project.
        $(BuildStepsPrepareGetVersion)                   - Gathers version information and stores it in a temporary file for use by the rest of the build process.
                                                           Currently supported methods of gathering version information are using (in order):
                                                           - The version defined by a custom MsBuild task which is defined in a file of which the path is stored

        $(BuildStepsPrepareReleaseNotes)                 - Gathers the release notes and stores them for later use during the build process. Release notes
                                                           are retrieved with the GitReleaseNotes tool (https://github.com/GitTools/GitReleaseNotes) which
                                                           currently allows gathering release notes from GitHub, Jira and YouTrack

        $(BuildStepsPrepareGenerateFiles)                - Generates one or more files from a set of template files.
        $(BuildStepsAnalyzeSourceCcm)                    - Analyzes the source code files with CCM.
        $(BuildStepsAnalyzeSourceSouceMonitor)           - Analyzes the source code files with SourceMonitor.
        $(BuildStepsBuildVisualStudioSolution)           - Builds the binaries from a given Visual Studio solution.
        $(BuildStepsUnitTestNUnit)                       - Executes the unit tests with NUnit and measures code coverage with OpenCover.
        $(BuildStepsUnitTestMsTest)                      - Executes the unit tests with MsTest and measures code coverage with OpenCover.
        $(BuildStepsAnalyzeBinariesMoma)                 - Analyzes the binary files with Moma (Mono Migration Analyzer).
        $(BuildStepsAnalyzeBinariesFxCop)                - Analyzes the binary files with FxCop.
        $(BuildStepsBuildApiDocumentationWithSandcastle) - Builds the API documentation with SandCastle from the inline XML documentation comments.

        $(BuildStepsPackZip)                             - Generates one or more ZIP archives.

        Additional build steps can be defined by providing the path to the MsBuild script that should be executed
        for that step, e.g. adding a build step that points to the 'c:\stuff\MyCoolScript.msbuild' will execute
        that script.

        Each script has the following properties passed to it:
        $(BuildPropertyFile)                             - The full path to the settings.props file (i.e. this file).
        $(ShouldDisplayDebugLog)                         - A flag indicating whether or not to display debug log information, usually at the start of the script execution.
        $(NBuildKitVersion)                              - The full version of the nBuildKit library that is executing the build.
        $(DirMsBuildExtensions)                          - The full path to the directory that contains the nBuildKit extension scripts.
        $(DirMsBuildShared)                              - The full path to the directory that contains the nBuildKit shared scripts.
        $(DirMsBuildTemplates)                           - The full path to the directory that contains the nBuildKit templates.

        Three different ways of referencing the test projects public key are available. Test assemblies
        can be referenced by:
        - Providing the snk key that was / is used to sign the test assembly. This is mainly of use
          for test assemblies which are compiled at the same time as the target assemblies, i.e. test
          assemblies that are part of the same Visual Studio solution.
        - Providing the signed test assembly. This is mainly of use for test assemblies that have been
          compiled prior to compiling the target assemblies, e.g. third party test assemblies.
        - Providing the full public key for the assembly. This is mainly of use for assemblies that
          do not exists on disk, e.g. assemblies that are dynamically generated.

        Multiple projects can be referenced in the 'projects' section by separating them with a semi-colon (;). Whitespace
        can be added if required but it has no influence on the project list.
