        Implementation note:
        This item group handles overriding in a 'special' way in that we can't conditionally load individual
        items because MsBuild doesn't allow that for global ItemGroup-s. But we can filter out duplicates
        later on (when we manipulate the list), so because we import the user specific information first
        we can throw away the default values if there is already a value for it.

        Currently this list is used only the 'shared.templatetokens' script where it does the filtering.
