        The following ItemGroup defines which steps are taken during the deploy process. The order of the items in the item group
        determines in which order the deploy steps are executed.

        The following default steps are always executed:
        - Restoring the NuGet packages as specified in the '$(DirWorkspace)\packages.config' file. Additionally also restores the
          NuGet packages as specified in the nBuildKit specific 'packages.config' files.

        The following deploy steps are by default provided through the given properties:
        $(DeployStepsPrepareVcsBranch)    - When building from a GIT repository on Jenkins ensures that the current checkout has the same branch
                                            name as the remote tracking branch.
        $(DeployStepsPrepareGetVersion)   - Gathers version information and stores it in a temporary file for use by the rest of the deploy process.
                                            Currently supported methods of gathering version information are using (in order):
                                            - The version defined by a custom MsBuild task which is defined in a file of which the path is stored
                                                in the 'VersionScriptPath' property. The task should output:
                                                - VersionMajor
                                                - VersionMinor
                                                - VersionPatch
                                                - VersionBuild
                                                - VersionPreRelease
                                                - VersionSemantic
                                                - VersionSemanticFull
                                                - VersionSemanticNuget
                                            - The version stored in an 'version.xml' file which contains an MsBuild property group with
                                                the properties:
                                                - BuildNumber
                                                - VersionMajor
                                                - VersionMinor
                                                - VersionPatch
                                                - VersionBuild
                                                - VersionPreRelease
                                            - The GitVersion tool (https://github.com/ParticularLabs/GitVersion)
                                            - The GitHubFlowVersion tool (https://github.com/JakeGinnivan/GitHubFlowVersion)
        $(DeployStepsPrepareTagVcs)       - Tags the current commit with the version number. Currently supported version control systems are TFS and GIT.
        $(DeployStepsPrepareGetIssueIds)  - Gets the issue IDs from the commits on the current branch and stores them in a temp file for later use.
        $(DeployStepsPushToTags)          - Pushes the tags to a remote git repository
        $(DeployStepsPushToNuget)         - Pushes one or more artifacts to a NuGet feed
        $(DeployStepsPushToDirectory)     - Pushes one or more artifacts to a directory
        $(DeployStepsPushToSymbolServer)  - Pushes one or more NuGet symbol packages to a local symbol server on a UNC path
        $(DeployStepsPushToGitHubRelease) - Pushes zero or more files to a GitHub release
        $(DeployStepsPushToGitBranch)     - Pushes zero or more files to a Git branch. Any files that currently exist on that branch are removed
                                            and replaced by the specified files.
        $(DeployStepsPushToGitRepository) - Pushes an archived local workspace to a Git repository.

        Additional deploy steps can be defined by providing the path to the MsBuild script that should be executed
        for that step, e.g. adding a deploy step that points to the 'c:\stuff\MyCoolScript.msbuild' will execute
        that script.

        Each script has the following properties passed to it:
        $(ShouldDisplayDebugLog)          - A flag indicating whether or not to display debug log information, usually at the start of the script execution.
        $(NBuildKitVersion)               - The full version of the nBuildKit library that is executing the build.
        $(DirNBuildKitMsBuild)            - The full path to the directory that contains the nBuildKit scripts.
        $(DirNBuildKitMsBuildShared)      - The full path to the directory that contains the shared nBuildkit scripts.
        $(DirNBuildKitMsBuildExtensions)  - The full path to the directory that contains the nBuildKit extension scripts.
        $(DirNBuildKitMsBuildTemplates)   - The full path to the directory that contains the nBuildKit templates.
